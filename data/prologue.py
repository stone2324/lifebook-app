#### Prologue, Prologue

* Lifebook - Prologue

They say facing our own mortality can teach us a lot. 
As I reflect, I feel compelled to write down the lessons I have learned over the years.

I hope that, in time, you will understand what those arguments were really about.
That you'll see the intentions behind my actions - even if I didn't handle things perfectly.

Always remember, you are stronger than you think. 
Life will challenge you, but that strength within you will see you through, even when it feels overwhelming.
You never held back when you argued with me, so I know with certainty that you have everything you need inside you.
