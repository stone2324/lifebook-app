They say mortality is lifeâ€™s greatest teacher.
On my bucket list is an item to write down the lessons I have learned over the years.

I hope that, in time, you will understand what the outbursts and nagging were about.

Life will challenge you, but that strength within you will see you through, even when it feels overwhelming.
When you stood up to me, you used all your strength, and I know you carry everything you need within you.

Remember, you are stronger than you think.
